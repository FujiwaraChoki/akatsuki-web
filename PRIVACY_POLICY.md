**Effective Date:** October 24, 2025
**Last Updated:** October 24, 2025

## Introduction

Akatsuki is a simple marketing site for the forthcoming Akatsuki iOS app. This privacy policy describes what information is collected when you visit the website located at https://akatsuki.app (the “Site”).

## Information We Collect

The Site is a static landing page. We do not embed analytics, advertising beacons, social widgets, or login functionality. As a result, we do **not** collect, store, or process personal data from visitors.

If you choose to contact us by email (e.g., by tapping the “Contact” link), your message will be delivered directly to the Akatsuki team. Your email address and the contents of your message will be used solely to respond to your enquiry.

## Cookies and Tracking

The Site does not set cookies and does not perform any form of traffic tracking or profiling.

## Data Sharing

We do not sell, rent, or share visitor information with third parties. Email correspondence you initiate will never be disclosed unless required by law.

## Data Security

Email correspondence is handled through standard email providers. While we take reasonable steps to secure communications, email is not an inherently secure medium. Please avoid sharing sensitive information.

## Children’s Privacy

The Site is not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. The “Last Updated” date at the top of this page reflects the most recent revision. Material changes will be posted on the Site.
